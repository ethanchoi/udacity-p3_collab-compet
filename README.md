# udacity-p3_collab-compet
This is a Collaboration and Competition project of Udacity


## Project Details
This project is one of the udactiy deep reinforcement learning nano degree program. For this project, you will work with [Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment.

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation. Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.

#### Solve the Environments
The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single score for each episode.

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those scores is at least **+0.5.**


## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to explore the environment on your own machine!

#### Step 1: Activate the Environment
If you haven't already, please follow the [instructions in the DRLND GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) to set up your Python environment. These instructions can be found in README.md at the root of the repository. By following these instructions, you will install PyTorch, the ML-Agents toolkit, and a few more Python packages required to complete the project.

#### Step 2: Download the Unity Environment

For this project, you will not need to install Unity - you can download it from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

- Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux.zip)
- Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis.app.zip)
- Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86.zip)
- Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86_64.zip)

Then, place the file in the p3_collab-compet/ folder in the DRLND GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

## Instructions
Follow the instructions in Tennis.ipynb to get started with training your own agent! you will see how to train a pair of agents to play tennis.<br>
After finishing your agent training, you can check a score by plotting average scores over episodes.
It will tell you how many epsiodes in your model are needed to get +0.5 average score. you can also save model weights and load it later.
